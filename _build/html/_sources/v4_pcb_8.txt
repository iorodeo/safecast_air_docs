8) GPS, LCD and XBEE Headers
==================================

Use the remainder of the 36-position (pos) female breakaway header to break off the following headers: 

* 8 pos header x 1
* 9 pos header x 1

Solder these into positions U1 (9 pos header) and U3 (8 pos header). 
These female headers will be used to connect the Adafruit Ultimate GPS Breakout and Adafruit Monochrome 1.3" or 0.96" 128x64 OLED graphic display later in the instructions.
